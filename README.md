============================

This script implements a device that when triggered, hacks vehicles in a defined radius distance and  
drives them at max speed to the exact location where the device was triggered.

### Requirements

This script only works on the QBCore Framework.

### Installation

1. Place the `assets/shell_device.png` image in your **qb-inventory** at `qb-inventory/html/images/shell_device.png`

2. Now you can place the `qb-traffic-hack` foldere in your **resources** folder

3. Make sure that the `qb-traffic-hack` script is started, add `ensure qb-traffic-hack` line to `resources.cfg` file.


At this point you should have the script working.

Keep in mind that you'll need to implement your own logic for how to acquire this device in roleplay.  
But for testing purposes you can give yourself the item with following command: `/giveitem [playerid] trafficbomb`
